Complete details on each type of Personal Data collected are provided in the dedicated sections of this Privacy Policy or by specific explanation texts displayed before the Data collection.</p><p>
The User may freely provide Personal Data or, in the case of Usage Data, collected automatically when using the Platform. Unless specified otherwise, all Data requested by the Platform is mandatory. Failure to provide this Data may make it impossible for the Platform to provide its Services. In cases where the Platform specifically states that some Data is not mandatory, Users are free not to communicate this Data without affecting the Service’s availability or functioning. Users uncertain about which Personal Data is mandatory are welcome to contact the Owner.
Any use of Cookies, or any other tracking tools, by this Platform or by the owners of third-party services used by this Platform serves the purpose of providing the Service required by the User, in addition to any other purposes described in the present document and the Cookie Policy.</p><p>
Users are responsible for any third-party Personal Data obtained, published, or shared through this Platform and confirm that they have the third party's consent to provide the Data to the Owner.
</p>
          <h4>Data Processing</h4>
          <h5>Methods of Processing</h5>
          <p>The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized destruction of the Data. Data Processing is carried out using computers and IT-enabled tools, following organizational procedures and modes strictly related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the Owner, in some cases, the Data may be accessible to certain persons involved with the operation of the Platform (such as but not limited to: administration, sales, marketing, legal, and system administration) or external parties (such as but not limited to: third party technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies and communications agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors by the Owner. An updated list of these parties may be requested from the Owner at any time.</p>
          <h4>Legal Basis of Data Processing</h4>
          <p>The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if any one of the following applies:
          <ul>
<li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations, the Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such Data Processing (“opt-out”), without relying on consent or any other legal bases. This, however, does not apply whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to European data protection law.</li>
<li>provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof.</li>
<li>Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject.</li>
<li>Processing is related to a task carried out in the public interest or the exercise of official authority vested in the Owner.</li>
<li>Processing is necessary for the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.</li></ul>
In any case, the Owner will help clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the Data Processing and whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement or a requirement necessary to enter a contract.
</p>
<h4>Place</h4>
<p>Data Processing is carried out at the Owner's operating offices and in any other places where the parties involved in the Data Processing are located.<br>
Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve transferring the User's Data to a country other than their own. To find out more about the place of processing of such transferred Data, Users can refer to the section “Detailed information on the processing of Personal Data.”<br>
Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data transfers to a country outside of the European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries (such as the UN) and about the security measures taken by the Owner to safeguard their Personal Data.<br>
If any such transfer occurs, Users can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this Privacy Policy or inquire with the Owner using the information provided in the contact section.
</p>
<h4>Retention time</h4>
<p>Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose/s it has been collected for. Therefore:
<ul>
<li>Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between the Owner and the User shall be retained until such agreement has been fully executed.</li>
<li>Personal Data collected for the Owner’s legitimate interests shall be retained if needed to fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner within the relevant sections of this Privacy Policy or by contacting the Owner.</li></ul>
The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a more extended period whenever the User has given consent to such Data Processing if such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to retain Personal Data for a more extended period whenever required to perform a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.<br>
Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification, and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.
</p>
<h4>The purposes of Processing</h4>
<p>Personal Data belonging to the User is collected to allow the Owner to provide its Service, comply with its legal obligations, respond to enforcement requests, protect its rights and interests (or those of its Users or third parties) or detect any malicious or fraudulent activity.
