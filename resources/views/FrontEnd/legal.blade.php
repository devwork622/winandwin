<p>In this Disclaimer, capitalized words and expressions used but not defined shall have the meanings in the Rules.</p>
<p>The Platform, any communication by or on behalf of Us, and the information contained therein is directed only at persons eligible to create an Account and Enter Games. They are not meant to entice or encourage Participants who do not meet Our eligibility criteria to Enter Games and are not an offer or invitation by the Manager to any person.</p>
<p>By accessing the Platform, registering for an Account, and Entering Games, you acknowledge that You are responsible for ensuring that it is legal for You to create and access Your Account and Enter Games in the jurisdiction in which You are physically located when transacting with Us. We are not liable to pay a Prize to any Participant in respect of any Entry which occurred while the Participant was physically located in a jurisdiction in which such Entry is unlawful.</p>
<p>We make no warranties, guarantees, or representations, of any kind, express or implied, as to the accuracy, availability, completeness, suitability, or reliability of the Content and information contained on the Platform or other communications sent by or on behalf of Us for any purpose. Any reliance placed on such information is strictly at Your own risk.</p>
<p>The Manager and its officers, members, and employees accept no liability for loss or damage (including, without limitation, indirect or consequential loss or damage or other losses or damage of whatever kind) that arises out of or in connection with the use of the Platform or reliance on the contents. By accessing the Platform, you agree that You will not bring any claim against the Manager, its officers, members, or employees regarding any losses you suffer in connection with the Platform.</p>
<p>By using the Platform, you expressly agree that use is at Your sole risk. We do not warrant that the Platform will be uninterrupted or error-free. Under no circumstances, including but not limited to negligence, shall We, Our Managers, officers or employees, or any other parties involved in creating, producing, or delivering the Platform be liable for any damages whatsoever (including, without limitation, any direct, incidental, consequential, indirect, or punitive damages) arising out of or related to Your access to, use of, or inability to access or use the Platform, or other locations accessible through the Platform, even if We have advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
<p>If any provision of this Disclaimer is found unenforceable under applicable law, it will not affect the enforceability of the other conditions stated within it.</p>
<p>The Platform operates under the laws of the UAE, and any disputes and legal proceedings will be heard in the UAE Courts.</p>
<h4>Syndication Members</h4>
<p>We disclaim any liability, including any express or implied warranties, whether oral or written to any Syndicate Members. By Entering Games, you acknowledge that we have made no representation that We shall be responsible for or have any liability for any purported claim from a Syndicate Member. To avoid doubt, we will only be liable for any valid claim made by the registered account holder with the winning Entry.
Where a Participant Enters Games with the intent of sharing a Prize with Syndicate Members, the Participant is:</p>
<p>1. Deemed to be the Participant for the Rules; and<br>
2. Is not acting as Our agent for that purpose, and We shall not be:<br>
- Liable for the payment of any Prize to any Syndicate Member other than a Prize emanating from a winning Entry which is payable only to the registered holder of the Account with such winning Entry; and
- Bound by any agreement between the registered holder of the Account and any Syndicate Member.
